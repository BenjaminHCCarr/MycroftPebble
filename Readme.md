# Mycroft for Pebble

This is the start of a Pebble watch companion app to the [Mycroft AI](https://github.com/MycroftAI). It works by opening a websocket connection to the [Mycroft-core](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/) messagebus and sending and receiving messages from there.

---

Currently everything is hard coded. We are looking to interface with the [Mycroft Android App](https://github.com/MycroftAI/Mycroft-Android) from the watch as a gateway to the core AI.

We intend to use the Time and beyond model microphones to implement voice recognition and Text To Speech (TTS) from the watch to Mycroft-core](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/).
